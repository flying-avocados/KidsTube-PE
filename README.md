# Project Goal
To develop and implement a comprehensive case study of a video-sharing website designed to effectively teach privacy threat modeling concepts and techniques to students and privacy engineering professionals
# Project Description
Privacy threat modeling is a crucial skill for individuals and organizations involved in the design, development, and deployment of systems and applications that handle personal data. This capstone project will address the need for practical and engaging educational materials by creating a real-world case study that learners can use to understand and apply privacy threat modeling methodologies. 
# Learning Outcomes for Users of the Case Study

Upon completion of this case study, learners will be able to:
- Understand the importance of privacy threat modeling in the development lifecycle.
- Identify and analyze personal data assets within a system.
- Apply a structured privacy threat modeling framework to a real-world scenario.
- Identify potential LINDDUN and UsersFirst privacy threats and vulnerabilities, which can be extendable to threats from other privacy threat-modeling frameworks.
- Assess the potential impact of privacy breaches on individuals and organizations.
- Propose and evaluate mitigation strategies and privacy-enhancing technologies.
- Communicate privacy risks effectively.

This project will contribute to the development of valuable educational resources for teaching privacy threat modeling. The resulting case study can be used in academic courses such as Engineering Privacy in Software, professional training offered through the CMU Privacy Engineering program, and self-learning initiatives to equip individuals with the essential skills to proactively address privacy risks in the design and development of systems.

# Case Study Description 
KidsTube is a U.S video streaming service for children that is similar to other streaming services in most aspects: content creators upload and delete content, the service shares videos to users based on internal recommendation systems, and users view, like, and comment on uploaded videos. A unique feature of this service is that it allows parents to approve video content for their children and monitor their search and watch histories. Note that since this service is targeted towards children under the age of 13, it is subject to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
