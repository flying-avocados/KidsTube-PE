            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
              KidsTube ("we," "our," or "us") is a video‚Äëstreaming platform designed for children under the supervision of their parents or legal guardians (collectively, "parents"). Protecting children's privacy is our highest priority. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard personal information when parents and children use KidsTube and its related services (the "Service"). It also outlines the tools we provide parents to control their child's experience, including the ability to approve or disapprove videos.

            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>

Because KidsTube is primarily directed to children in the United States, we comply with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") and other applicable laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") and the EU/UK General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR").
